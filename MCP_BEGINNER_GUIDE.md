# MCP Beginner's Guide: How AI Agents and MCP Services Work Together

## ü§î What is This Project About?

This project shows you how to build an **AI Agent** that can actually **do things** by talking to an **MCP Service**. Think of it like having a smart assistant that can not only chat with you, but also manage your tasks and projects by connecting to a database.

We built a complete system with two main parts:
1. **AI Agent Service** - The smart brain that understands what you want
2. **MCP Service** - The hands-on worker that actually does the work

## ü§î What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is like a "universal translator" that allows AI agents to use tools and services. Think of it as a standardized way for AI to interact with different applications.

**Simple Analogy**: Imagine MCP as a restaurant menu. The AI Agent is the customer, and our MCP Service is the kitchen. The menu (MCP) tells the AI what "dishes" (tools) are available and how to order them.

## üèóÔ∏è The Big Picture: What Happens When You Make a Request

Let's say you tell the AI agent: *"Create a new project called 'Learn Python' and add a task to read chapter 1"*

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

```
You ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí Gemini API ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí MCP Service ‚Üí Database
                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
               "Understand      "Create    "Execute   "Store
                the request"    a plan"    the plan"  the data"
```

## üß† The Two Main Parts

### 1. AI Agent Service (The Smart Brain) üß†

**What it does:**
- Listens to your requests (like "create a project")
- Uses Google's Gemini AI to understand what you want
- Figures out which tools it needs to use
- Talks to the MCP Service to get things done
- Gives you a nice response back

**Think of it like:** A smart secretary who understands what you want and knows how to get it done.

**Where it lives:** http://localhost:8000

### 2. MCP Service (The Hands-On Worker) üõ†Ô∏è

**What it does:**
- Provides "tools" that can actually do things
- Manages projects and tasks in the database
- Handles all the database operations
- Responds to requests from the AI Agent

**Think of it like:** A skilled worker who has all the tools and knows how to use them.

**Where it lives:** http://localhost:8001

## üîß What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is like a **standard language** that AI agents use to talk to services that can do real work.

### Before MCP (The Old Way)
```
AI Agent: "I want to create a task"
Service: "Huh? What format? What fields? How do I do that?"
```

### With MCP (The New Way)
```
AI Agent: "Hey MCP Service, what tools do you have?"
MCP Service: "I have create_task, list_tasks, update_task, delete_task"
AI Agent: "Great! Use create_task with this data..."
MCP Service: "Done! Here's what I created."
```

## üîÑ How They Work Together: A Real Example

Let's trace through what happens when you ask: *"Show me all my pending tasks"*

### Step 1: You Make a Request
```http
POST http://localhost:8000/agent/process
{
  "message": "Show me all my pending tasks"
}
```

### Step 2: AI Agent Understands Your Request
The AI Agent sends your message to Gemini AI:
- **Gemini thinks:** "The user wants to see tasks with status 'pending'"
- **Gemini decides:** "I need to use the list_tasks tool"

### Step 3: AI Agent Calls MCP Service
```http
POST http://localhost:8001/tools/list_tasks
{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Step 4: MCP Service Does the Work
- Connects to PostgreSQL database
- Runs: `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending'`
- Gets the results

### Step 5: MCP Service Responds
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Read Python chapter 1",
      "status": "pending",
      "project": "Learn Python"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Practice loops",
      "status": "pending", 
      "project": "Learn Python"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: AI Agent Gives You a Nice Response
```json
{
  "response": "You have 2 pending tasks:
  1. Read Python chapter 1 (Learn Python project)
  2. Practice loops (Learn Python project)
  
  Would you like me to help you with any of these?"
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tools Available in Our MCP Service

Our MCP Service provides these tools (think of them as superpowers for the AI):

### Project Management Tools
- **create_project**: Make a new project
- **list_projects**: Show all projects
- **get_project**: Get details about one project
- **update_project**: Change project information
- **delete_project**: Remove a project

### Task Management Tools
- **create_task**: Make a new task
- **list_tasks**: Show tasks (can filter by status, project, etc.)
- **get_task**: Get details about one task
- **update_task**: Change task information (like marking it complete)
- **delete_task**: Remove a task

## üí™ Why This Architecture is Powerful

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **AI Agent**: Focuses on understanding and conversation
- **MCP Service**: Focuses on doing actual work
- **Database**: Focuses on storing data safely

### 2. Reusable Components
- The MCP Service can be used by other AI agents
- The AI Agent can talk to other MCP services
- Each part can be updated independently

### 3. Scalable
- Need more AI power? Scale the AI Agent
- Need more database performance? Scale the MCP Service
- Each service can grow independently

## ‚ùì Common Beginner Questions

### Q: Why not just put everything in one service?
**A:** Imagine if your brain had to also be your hands. It would be confusing! By separating the "thinking" (AI Agent) from the "doing" (MCP Service), each part can focus on what it does best.

### Q: What if I want to add new capabilities?
**A:** Easy! Just add new tools to the MCP Service. The AI Agent will automatically discover them and start using them.

### Q: How does the AI Agent know what tools are available?
**A:** When it starts up, it asks the MCP Service: "What tools do you have?" The MCP Service responds with a list of all available tools and how to use them.

### Q: What happens if the database is down?
**A:** The MCP Service will return an error, and the AI Agent will tell you something like "Sorry, I can't access your tasks right now. Please try again later."

## üåê The Technical Flow (Simplified)

### **When an AI Agent Wants to Create a Project:**

1. **You make a request** to the AI Agent:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8000/agent/process
   {
     "message": "Create a project called My New Project"
   }
   ```

2. **AI Agent understands** using Gemini AI:
   - Gemini figures out you want to create a project
   - AI Agent decides to use the create_project tool

3. **AI Agent calls MCP Service**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:8001/tools/create_project
   {
     "name": "My New Project",
     "description": "A cool project"
   }
   ```

4. **MCP Service does the work**:
   - Validates the data (is the name provided? is it not too long?)
   - Calls the database to store it
   - Returns a response

5. **Database stores it** in the `projects` table

6. **MCP Service responds** to the AI Agent:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Project created successfully",
     "data": {
       "id": 123,
       "name": "My New Project",
       "status": "active",
       "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

7. **AI Agent gives you a nice response**:
   ```json
   {
     "response": "Great! I've created your project 'My New Project'. It's been assigned ID #123 and is now active. Would you like me to add some tasks to it?"
   }
   ```

## üè† Our Service Architecture

### **The Components:**

1. **FastAPI Web Server** (Port 8001)
   - Receives HTTP requests from AI agents
   - Handles MCP protocol communication
   - Routes requests to the right tools

2. **MCP Tools** (The actual functionality)
   - `project_tools.py` - Handles project operations
   - `task_tools.py` - Handles task operations

3. **Database Layer**
   - `connection.py` - Manages database connections
   - `operations.py` - Performs database CRUD operations

4. **PostgreSQL Database** (Port 5432)
   - Stores projects in `projects` table
   - Stores tasks in `tasks` table
   - Tasks can reference projects (foreign key relationship)

### **The Data Flow:**
```
AI Agent Request ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí MCP Tool ‚Üí Database Operation ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Response Back
```

## üìä Database Structure (Super Simple)

### **Projects Table:**
| Column | What It Stores |
|--------|----------------|
| id | Unique project number |
| name | Project name |
| description | What the project is about |
| status | active, completed, etc. |
| created_at | When it was made |

### **Tasks Table:**
| Column | What It Stores |
|--------|----------------|
| id | Unique task number |
| project_id | Which project it belongs to (optional) |
| title | Task name |
| description | What the task is about |
| status | pending, in_progress, completed, etc. |
| priority | low, medium, high, urgent |
| assigned_to | Who should do it |
| due_date | When it's due |

## üöÄ Hands-On: Try It Yourself!

### 1. Start the Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Test the AI Agent
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a project called My First Project"}'
```

### 3. Test the MCP Service Directly
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/tools/list_projects
```

### 4. Check the Database
Visit http://localhost:8080 (pgAdmin) to see the data that was created.

### 5. Try More Complex Requests
```bash
# Ask the AI Agent to do multiple things
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a project called Learn Python and add a task to read chapter 1"}'
```

## üîß Troubleshooting for Beginners

### "I can't access the services"
- Check if Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- All should show "healthy" status

### "The AI Agent gives weird responses"
- Check if your Gemini API key is set correctly in `.env`
- Look at the logs: `docker-compose logs ai-agent`

### "I can't see my data in pgAdmin"
- Make sure you're using the right login (from your `.env` file)
- Check if the database container is healthy: `docker-compose ps postgres`

### "The services won't start"
- Check if the ports are already in use: `lsof -i :8000 -i :8001 -i :5432 -i :8080`
- Try restarting: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
