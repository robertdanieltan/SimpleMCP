# Product Overview

## AI Agent MCP Service Learning Project

This is a comprehensive learning project focused on **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** service development and AI agent integration. The project demonstrates how to build AI agents that interact with MCP services for task and project management.

### Core Purpose
- Educational foundation for AI agent development
- Practical implementation of MCP services using FastAPI
- Integration patterns between AI agents and HTTP-based MCP services
- Multi-service orchestration with Docker

### Key Learning Areas
- **MCP Development**: HTTP-based service architecture with FastAPI/FastMCP
- **AI Agent Integration**: Using Gemini API for natural language processing
- **Containerization**: Docker best practices for AI services
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Multi-service Architecture**: Orchestration patterns with Docker Compose

### Target Users
Beginners learning AI agent development and MCP service implementation following KISS (Keep It Simple) principles.

### Current Status
New project in development phase - serves as a practical learning foundation.
