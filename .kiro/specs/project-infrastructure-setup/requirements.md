# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for the AI Agent MCP Service Learning Project. The infrastructure includes a multi-service Docker architecture with separate containers for AI agent service, MCP service, PostgreSQL database, and pgAdmin interface. This setup provides the base platform for learning AI agent development and MCP service implementation using FastAPI and Python.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning AI agent development, I want a complete project structure with organized directories, so that I can understand the separation of concerns between different services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create separate directories for ai-agent-service, mcp-service, and database components
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN each service directory SHALL contain appropriate configuration files (Dockerfile, requirements.txt, main.py)
3. WHEN reviewing the root directory THEN it SHALL contain docker-compose.yml, .env.example, and comprehensive README.md files
4. WHEN inspecting service directories THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions (kebab-case for directories, snake_case for Python files)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker containerization for all services, so that I can run the entire system consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN docker-compose up is executed THEN the system SHALL start all four services (ai-agent, mcp-service, postgresql, pgadmin)
2. WHEN services are running THEN the AI agent service SHALL be accessible on port 8000
3. WHEN services are running THEN the MCP service SHALL be accessible on port 8001
4. WHEN services are running THEN PostgreSQL SHALL be accessible on port 5432
5. WHEN services are running THEN pgAdmin SHALL be accessible on port 8080
6. WHEN a service fails THEN Docker SHALL automatically restart the service
7. WHEN checking service health THEN each service SHALL provide health check endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a PostgreSQL database with proper initialization and test data, so that I can immediately start working with realistic data scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database container starts THEN it SHALL automatically execute initialization scripts
2. WHEN the database is initialized THEN it SHALL create the required schema for task and project management
3. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL populate the database with meaningful test data
4. WHEN connecting to the database THEN it SHALL support synchronous operations only
5. WHEN accessing pgAdmin THEN it SHALL be pre-configured to connect to the PostgreSQL instance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want FastAPI-based services with proper structure, so that I can understand how to build HTTP-based MCP services and AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI agent service starts THEN it SHALL provide a FastAPI application with health and status endpoints
2. WHEN the MCP service starts THEN it SHALL provide a FastMCP-based application with tool endpoints
3. WHEN examining service code THEN each SHALL follow the established app module structure
4. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use HTTP REST API calls between containers
5. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN each service SHALL have appropriate requirements.txt with FastAPI, database drivers, and service-specific packages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive environment configuration, so that I can easily customize API keys, database credentials, and service settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN it SHALL provide a .env.example file with all required environment variables
2. WHEN configuring the environment THEN it SHALL include placeholders for GEMINI_API_KEY, database credentials, and pgAdmin settings
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL read configuration from environment variables
4. WHEN the .env file is missing THEN services SHALL provide clear error messages about required configuration
5. WHEN examining configuration THEN it SHALL include DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL connection string

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions, so that I can understand the project architecture and get started quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README.md THEN it SHALL explain the project purpose, architecture, and learning objectives
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN they SHALL include step-by-step Docker commands and environment configuration
3. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN it SHALL include service communication patterns and port mappings
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the documentation SHALL provide common commands for logs, health checks, and container management
5. WHEN learning from the project THEN the documentation SHALL explain the KISS principles and educational focus
