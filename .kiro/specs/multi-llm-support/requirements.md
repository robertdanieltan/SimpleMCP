# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the AI Agent MCP Service to support multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers beyond the current Gemini-only implementation. The system will support OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama (for local LLM deployment) alongside Gemini, providing flexibility, redundancy, and the ability to leverage the unique strengths of different AI providers. This enhancement maintains backward compatibility while introducing a provider abstraction layer that allows for dynamic provider selection, fallback mechanisms, and future extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) so that the AI agent can use different providers based on availability and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration for all available LLM providers from environment variables
2. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL validate API keys and connectivity for each provider during initialization
3. WHEN a provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue with valid providers
4. WHEN no providers are configured THEN the system SHALL start in fallback mode with limited functionality
5. WHEN provider configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime reconfiguration without restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified LLM provider interface so that the agent core logic remains consistent regardless of which LLM provider is being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing LLM providers THEN each provider SHALL implement a common interface with standardized methods
2. WHEN calling LLM functions THEN the interface SHALL provide consistent response formats across all providers
3. WHEN a provider fails THEN the interface SHALL return standardized error responses
4. WHEN adding new providers THEN the interface SHALL support extension without modifying existing code
5. WHEN provider-specific features are needed THEN the interface SHALL allow optional provider-specific parameters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the AI agent to automatically handle provider failures by switching to alternative providers so that my requests are processed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primary provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt the request with the next available provider
2. WHEN all providers fail THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message and fallback to rule-based responses where possible
3. WHEN a provider recovers from failure THEN the system SHALL automatically include it back in the rotation
4. WHEN provider switching occurs THEN the system SHALL log the switch for monitoring purposes
5. WHEN fallback is triggered THEN the response SHALL indicate which provider was used or if fallback mode was activated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and status of all configured LLM providers so that I can ensure system reliability and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking system health THEN the health endpoint SHALL report the status of all configured LLM providers
2. WHEN a provider is unavailable THEN the status SHALL clearly indicate which provider is down and why
3. WHEN querying provider status THEN the system SHALL provide response time metrics and availability statistics
4. WHEN providers have different capabilities THEN the status SHALL indicate what features are available per provider
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN logs SHALL include provider selection decisions and performance metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with existing Gemini-only configurations so that current deployments continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN only GEMINI_API_KEY is configured THEN the system SHALL operate exactly as before with Gemini as the sole provider
2. WHEN existing environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL not require any configuration changes for current users
3. WHEN API responses are generated THEN the response format SHALL remain consistent with existing implementations
4. WHEN existing endpoints are called THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
5. WHEN upgrading the system THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced to the public API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure provider selection strategies (primary, fallback order, load balancing) so that I can optimize performance and reliability based on my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring providers THEN the system SHALL support setting a primary provider preference
2. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL support configurable fallback ordering
3. WHEN load balancing is enabled THEN the system SHALL distribute requests across available providers
4. WHEN provider costs differ THEN the system SHALL support cost-aware provider selection
5. WHEN specific use cases require it THEN the system SHALL support request-type-based provider routing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for multi-provider scenarios so that I can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provider errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including provider name and error type
2. WHEN fallback is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the fallback chain and reasons for each provider failure
3. WHEN providers have rate limits THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully and log rate limit events
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support detailed logging levels for provider interactions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support local LLM deployment through Ollama so that the system can run completely offline and maintain data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ollama is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to local Ollama instances via HTTP API
2. WHEN Ollama models are available THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and list available local models
3. WHEN using Ollama THEN the system SHALL support model selection and switching between different local models
4. WHEN Ollama is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to cloud providers if configured
5. WHEN running offline THEN the system SHALL function fully with only Ollama as the provider
6. WHEN Ollama configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support dynamic model loading and unloading

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to specify which LLM provider to use when starting an MCP learning session so that I can have a consistent experience with my chosen provider throughout the session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a learning session THEN the system SHALL require specification of a single LLM provider to use for that session
2. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL use only the specified provider for all requests within that session
3. WHEN multiple learners are active THEN each session SHALL independently use its specified provider without interference
4. WHEN a session provider becomes unavailable THEN the session SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages rather than switching providers
5. WHEN starting a new session THEN the system SHALL validate that the specified provider is available and configured
6. WHEN session configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the session creation with helpful error messages

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the AI agent to leverage the unique strengths of different LLM providers so that I can choose the best provider for my specific learning needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a provider THEN the system SHALL provide information about each provider's strengths and capabilities
2. WHEN using different providers THEN each SHALL maintain consistent API behavior while leveraging provider-specific optimizations
3. WHEN handling different languages THEN the system SHALL indicate which providers support specific languages best
4. WHEN processing complex requests THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on which providers handle different context window requirements
5. WHEN comparing providers THEN the system SHALL offer performance and capability comparisons to help users choose
